# MongoDB Aggregation Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the `$lookup`, `$unwind`, and `$project` stages together in a MongoDB aggregation pipeline.

The issue stems from the interaction of these operators under specific conditions.  The main problem was an unexpected manipulation of the data within the aggregation pipeline which was difficult to debug.

## Problem Description

The initial implementation resulted in an unexpected output from the aggregation pipeline.  The `$project` stage seemed to misinterpret data after the `$unwind` operation. The solution shows the error and the fix that corrects the issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
3. Populate your MongoDB database with the collections `collectionA` and `collectionB`, and follow the structure shown in the `bug.js` file. 
4. Run the `bug.js` file. Observe the unexpected results.
5. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code and the expected results.

## Solution

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` correctly uses the pipeline. The difference lies in explicitly handling potential data issues after the unwind stage to ensure reliable projection of data.
